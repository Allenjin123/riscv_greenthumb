=== RISC-V Synthesis Task for Claude Code ===

Target instruction(s) to synthesize:
  remu x1, x2, x3
  sub x0, x0, x0

Constraints:
- Length: 3 to 5 instructions
- Live-out registers: (1)
- Instruction group: remu-synthesis

Allowed instructions:
  divu, mul, sub, add

Your task:
1. Propose an instruction sequence that implements the target
2. Write your proposal to: claude-proposal.txt
3. Format: One instruction per line

Example format:
  xor x1, x2, x3
  sltu x3, x2, x3
  srli x2, x1, 31
  xor x1, x2, x3

After writing your proposal, run:
  racket interactive-synthesis.rkt --continue
