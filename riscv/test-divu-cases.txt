Test cases to understand divu vs div:

Case 1: Both positive
  x2=100, x3=10 (both positive as signed AND unsigned)
  div: 100/10 = 10
  divu: 100/10 = 10
  Same! ✓

Case 2: x2 negative (large unsigned)
  x2=-100 (4294967196 unsigned), x3=10
  div: -100/10 = -10
  divu: 4294967196/10 = 429496719
  Different! Need adjustment

Case 3: x3 negative (large unsigned divisor)
  x2=100, x3=-10 (4294967286 unsigned)
  div: 100/-10 = -10
  divu: 100/4294967286 = 0
  Different! Need adjustment

Case 4: Both negative
  x2=-100, x3=-10
  div: -100/-10 = 10
  divu: 4294967196/4294967286 = 1
  Different!

Converting unsigned to signed division is VERY complex.
Need to handle overflow cases where unsigned values > 2^31.
