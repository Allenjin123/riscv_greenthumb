1. Memory object for backward search.
2. Documentation for efficient memory access.
3. Option to run hybrid without enumerative search.
4. Don't require users to implement
   - backward interpreter
   - instruction enumerator
   - update-liveness-bw


- Can potentially make memory-racket.rkt runs faster using different data structure.
- No longer need validator:proper-machine-config if we use the new memory access support.
  => Will memory object slowdown the interpreter?
  => keep ARM & GA as is.
