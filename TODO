1. Test with optimizer.rkt for all ISAs again.
2. Reread doc on github.
3. Documentation for efficient memory access.
4. Option to run hybrid without enumerative search.
5. Don't require users to implement
   - backward interpreter
   - instruction enumerator
   - update-liveness-bw
   - enumerator: commutative list


- No longer need validator:proper-machine-config if we use the new memory access support.
  => Will memory object slowdown the interpreter?
  => keep ARM & GA as is.
