Test on:
- llvm
- preston
- GA
- ARM
  = (get-arg-type) & (get-arg-ranges) take opcode-id not opcode-name

3. Revisit
   - (get-mutation) in stochastic
   - (reduce-precesion) in forwardbackward
   - (get-flag) in enumerator


3. May need to override these functions
   - (reduce-precesion) in forwardbackward
   - (get-val-range) in -inverse
3. Documentation for efficient memory access.
   - memory access operates in a granularity of # of bits defined
4. Option to run hybrid without enumerative search.



- No longer need validator:proper-machine-config if we use the new memory access support.
  => Will memory object slowdown the interpreter?
  => keep ARM & GA as is.
