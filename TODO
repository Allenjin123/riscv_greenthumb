- printing SPEC, SKETCH, FORALL => 2nd seq doesn't terminate
- without printing, 1st + 2nd seqs together don't terminate
- why assume (interpret-spec) make it so much slower?
  => if none of arg is used for index, don't use (interpret-spec)?
- more than one init counterexamples

- binary search
- add fixed sequences
- reg/stack allocation
