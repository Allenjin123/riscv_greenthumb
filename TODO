Correctness
- how to prevent users from making a mistake on machine description (ins & outs).
  = e.g. putting arg 0 to be output of str# => backward can't find solution.
  = SOLUTION: extract ins & outs from simulator!!!

1. Revisit
   - use out instead of out-vec to get pruning-info
   - link to section in .md
   - link from new ISA to advance usage
   - remove prescreen
   - test one more time
   - remove (debug-inst) in forwardbackward & live-in in stoch

4. Increase precision in enum
   - synthesize constrants
   - in reduced-bitwidth domain: try all 4-bit constants
   - e.g. Preston load1
5. Advance usage
   - define-progstate-stype #:const
   - sort-live
   - combine-live & update-live (GA)
   - (reduce-precesion) in forwardbackward
