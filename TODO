3. Documentation for efficient memory access.
   - memory access operates in a granularity of # of bits defined
4. Option to run hybrid without enumerative search.
5. Don't require users to implement
   - backward interpreter
   - instruction enumerator
   - update-liveness-bw
   - enumerator: commutative list


- No longer need validator:proper-machine-config if we use the new memory access support.
  => Will memory object slowdown the interpreter?
  => keep ARM & GA as is.
