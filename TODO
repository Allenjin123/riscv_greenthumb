- bug uncaught exception: "traverse: unimplemented for #<assumption>"
- @b

- test prefix
  = with assumption
  = with indexrename
  = change size-limit back to 16

- time assume benchmark with 2 CEs
- udlr
- database
- less conservative complexity-estimator, define-if, define-rotate

- why assume (interpret-spec) make it so much slower?
  => if none of arg is used for index, don't use (interpret-spec)?

- add fixed sequences
- reg/stack allocation
